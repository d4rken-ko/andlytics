# Description

Project imported from last source code released by Timelappse (@andlytics) with fix by Maurizio Pinotti (@wwtwister).

Track your Android app's statistics.

Andlytics tracks app statistics for ratings, daily downloads, total downloads and active installs. Android Developers can view app comments in all languages and AdMob statistics for revenue, request and impressions.

This is a Android developer tool for app tracking, only useful if you have published applications on the Android Market and access to the Android Market Developer Console.

Supports auto sync of app stats with your android developer account. Statistics data can be exported to sdcard and you can configure notifications for comments, ratings and downloads. AdMob accounts will be managed by the Android account manager.

Please notice that Google doesn't provide a stable API to get download and rating stats. Therefore Andlytics might not work properly if something changes in the Android Market. In that case please be patient while we try to catch up with the changes.

This app is not related to Google in any way.

KNOWN ISSUES
★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★
- "Google Apps for Business" accounts are not supported yet
- On some devices AdMob accounts keep disappearing, moving Andlytics from sdcard to internal storage might fix this
- For AdMob accounts that are linked to a Google Account you can find the API password on the Account Information page http://www.admob.com/my_account/account_info.
